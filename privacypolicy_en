Privacy Policy of the Mobile Application

Effective Date: 02/24/2025

1. General Provisions
This Privacy Policy describes how your mobile application, Bluetooth Notification Reader, processes notifications and protects your privacy. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any data received by the application during its use.

2. Data Collection
The application does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data, including any information about notifications received by your device.
However, the application requests permission to access location data (both coarse and precise). We do not use, process, or transmit location data in any way. This permission is required solely to check the Bluetooth connection state, which is used to automatically enable or disable the notification reading function.

3. Data Usage
The application operates entirely on your device. Its functionality is limited to the following actions:

- Receiving notifications on your device.
- Comparing received notifications with categories specified by you in the app settings.
- Announcing notifications using the Text-To-Speech function if they match the selected categories.
- Requesting access to location data only to check the Bluetooth connection state. The actual location data is neither used, processed, nor transmitted.
No data is transmitted to the developer, third parties, or external servers.

4. Data Protection
Since the application operates exclusively on your device, all data is processed locally. We do not have access to your data and do not keep any records of it.

5. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the appâ€™s functionality or legal requirements. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
